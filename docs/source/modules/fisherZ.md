FISHERZ Applies the Fisher's r-to-z transformation to correlation coefficients.

  Z = FISHERZ(R)

  The Fisher transformation (often called Fisher's Z-transformation) is used
  to transform the sampling distribution of the Pearson correlation coefficient
  (r) from a non-normal (skewed) distribution to a distribution that is
  approximately normal. This makes the transformed variable Z more suitable
  for statistical inference, such as calculating confidence intervals or
  performing hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients.

  The formula for the transformation is:
      $$Z = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1+r}{1-r} \right)$$

  Input Arguments:
  R   - The Pearson correlation coefficient(s) (or any value between -1 and 1).
        Can be a scalar, vector, or matrix.

  Output Arguments:
  Z   - The Fisher's Z-transformed value(s). The output has the same size as R.

  Note: The input r must be in the range (-1, 1). Values of r = -1 or r = 1
        will result in Z = -Inf or Z = Inf, respectively.
