## Signature

```matlab
function [REST_MASK1,func_mask_path] = whifun_create_rest_mask(in_func_path,in_anat_mask_subj_space_path)
```

## Summary

WHIFUN_CREATE_REST_MASK Creates a brain mask in functional space.

## Syntax

```matlab
[REST_MASK1, func_mask_path] = WHIFUN_CREATE_REST_MASK(in_func_path, in_anat_mask_subj_space_path)
```

## Description

creates a brain mask for a functional image based on a pre-existing anatomical brain mask. This is a crucial step for subsequent analysis that needs to be restricted to brain tissue.

The function uses `reslice_data` (an assumed helper function, as it is not a standard MATLAB function) to resample the anatomical mask into the functional image's space. Reslicing ensures that the mask has the same dimensions and voxel-to-world mapping as the functional data, allowing for direct application.

## Input Arguments

### `in_func_path`
The path to the functional NIfTI file. This file's dimensions and transformations are used as a template for the new mask.

### `in_anat_mask_subj_space_path`
The path to the brain mask created from the anatomical image in the subject's native space.

## Output Arguments

### `REST_MASK1`
A `dir` structure pointing to the newly created mask file.

### `func_mask_path`
The full path to the created mask file. See also RESLICE_DATA, DIR, FULLFILE.
