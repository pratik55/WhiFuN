```

## Summary

WHIFUN_QC_COREG_SLOVER Creates a quality control image using SLover.

## Syntax

```matlab
WHIFUN_QC_COREG_SLOVER(image_1_path, image_2_path, out_image_path, slover_slices, slover_contour_range, slover_view)
```

## Description

generates a quality control image to visually inspect the alignment of two neuroimaging files, using a specialized function (`whifun_slover`) for creating overlaid slices.

This function is an alternative to `spm_check_registration` for creating a quality control image. It sets up an invisible SPM figure, calls a helper function (`whifun_slover`) to perform the visualization with specific parameters, and then exports the resulting figure to a file.

The visual output will show one image (e.g., anatomical) as a background with a contour of the other image (e.g., functional) overlaid on top, providing a clear way to assess the accuracy of the coregistration.

## Input Arguments

### `image_1_path`
The full path to the first image (e.g., anatomical).

### `image_2_path`
The full path to the second image (e.g., coregistered functional).

### `out_image_path`
The full path where the output QC image will be saved.

### `slover_slices`
A vector of slice locations to display.

### `slover_contour_range`
A two-element vector specifying the min and max values for the contour display.

### `slover_view`
The view to display the slices in (e.g., 'axial', 'coronal','sagittal). See also SPM_FIGURE, EXPORTGRAPHICS, MKDIR.
