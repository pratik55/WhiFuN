## MATLAB Help

WHIFUN_SEPERATE_LEFT_RIGHT Separates a Functional Network (FN) NIfTI volume
  into left and right hemispheric components based on the mid-sagittal slice.

  WHIFUN_SEPERATE_LEFT_RIGHT(FN_FILE_PATH, ONE_IMAGE)

  This utility function is used to create separate NIfTI files for the
  left (L) and right (R) halves of a clustered network map (e.g., WM-FN).

  Input Arguments:
  FN_FILE_PATH - Full path to the NIfTI file containing the clustered Functional Network.
                 (e.g., 'WM_FN_K10.nii').
  ONE_IMAGE    - (Optional, default 0) Flag to determine output format:
                 ONE_IMAGE = 0: Saves two separate NIfTI files: '_L' and '_R'.
                 ONE_IMAGE = 1: Saves a single NIfTI file '_L_R_seperated'
                                where the right hemisphere's network labels are
                                offset by K (the total number of original networks)
                                to ensure non-overlapping labels in the combined image.

  Output Files:
  - If ONE_IMAGE = 0:
    - <FN_name>_L.<ext>
    - <FN_name>_R.<ext>
  - If ONE_IMAGE = 1:
    - <FN_name>_L_R_seperated.<ext>

  Assumes: The NIfTI image is oriented such that the first dimension (X)
  corresponds to the Left-Right axis, and the center slice separates the
  left (1:Mid_sagittal_slice) from the right (Mid_sagittal_slice+1:end).

  Dependencies: 'whifun_niftiread', 'niftisave' functions.
