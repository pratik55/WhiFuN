## MATLAB Help

NIFTISAVE Saves a MATLAB array as a NIfTI-1 file, updating essential header
  information from a provided info structure.

  NIFTISAVE(NIFTIIMAGE, FILENAME, INFO, ADD_OFFSET, MULTI_SCALE)

  This is a utility wrapper for MATLAB's built-in `niftiwrite` function.
  It ensures that the NIfTI header information (INFO) is correctly updated
  to reflect the dimensions, datatype, and name of the image data being saved.

  Input Arguments:
  NIFTIIMAGE  - The MATLAB array (2D, 3D, or 4D) containing the image data
                to be saved as a NIfTI file.
  FILENAME    - The desired full path and filename (with extension, e.g., '.nii')
                for the output NIfTI file.
  INFO        - A structure, typically obtained from a previous `niftiread`
                call, containing the NIfTI header information (metadata)
                to use for the new file.
  ADD_OFFSET  - (Optional) Value to set as the 'AdditiveOffset' (qform/sform
                `qoffset_b` or `srow_b`) in the NIfTI header, used for adding offset.
  MULTI_SCALE - (Optional) Value to set as the 'MultiplicativeScaling'
                (sform/qform `qfac` or `srow_a`) in the NIfTI header, used for scaling.

  Output:
  A NIfTI file is saved to the location specified by FILENAME.
