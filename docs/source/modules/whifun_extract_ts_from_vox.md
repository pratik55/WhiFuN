WHIFUN_EXTRACT_TS_FROM_VOX Extracts time series data from a list of voxels.

  vox_ts = WHIFUN_EXTRACT_TS_FROM_VOX(func_img, vox_list) extracts the
  time series data for a specified set of voxels from a 4D functional
  neuroimaging image volume.

  The function first reshapes the 4D image data into a 2D matrix where
  each row represents a voxel and each column represents a time point.
  It then uses a list of voxel coordinates to extract the corresponding
  time series. This is an efficient way to get the data for a region
  of interest (ROI) without having to loop through each voxel.

  Input Arguments:
  func_img - A 4D matrix of functional image data `[nx ny nz nt]`.
  vox_list - An Nx3 array of voxel coordinates `[x y z]` where N is the
             number of voxels in the ROI.

  Output Arguments:
  vox_ts   - An NxT matrix where N is the number of voxels in the ROI
             and T is the number of time points. Each row is the time
             series for a single voxel.
