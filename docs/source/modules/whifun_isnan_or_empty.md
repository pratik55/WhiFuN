WHIFUN_ISNAN_OR_EMPTY Checks if a specific field in a structure is missing, empty, or NaN.

  Y = WHIFUN_ISNAN_OR_EMPTY(X, FIELD)

  This utility function provides a robust check for the existence and
  validity of a specified field within a MATLAB structure. It is commonly
  used in programs to validate configuration settings or subject data fields.

  Input Arguments:
  X     - The input MATLAB structure (struct).
  FIELD - A character vector or string specifying the name of the field to check
          (e.g., 'data_path').

  Output Arguments:
  Y     - A logical scalar (true or false).
          Y = true if:
            1. The field does not exist in the structure X (as determined by `isfield`).
            2. The field exists but its value is an empty array (`isempty(x)`).
            3. The field exists and its value is a NaN (Not-a-Number) and numeric.
          Y = false otherwise (field exists and contains non-empty, non-NaN data).
