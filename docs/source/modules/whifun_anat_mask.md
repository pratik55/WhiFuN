## MATLAB Help

WHIFUN_ANAT_MASK Generates a binary anatomical brain mask using SPM imcalc.

  output = WHIFUN_ANAT_MASK(out_mask_path, anat_path, GM_path, WM_path, CSF_path)
  combines Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) 
  tissue probability maps to create a single binary brain mask. A voxel is 
  included in the mask if the sum of its GM, WM, and CSF probabilities is 
  greater than 0.5. The SPM GUI is suppressed during execution.

  Dependencies: 
      This function requires SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) to be 
      installed and in the MATLAB search path.

  Inputs:
      out_mask_path - String or char array specifying the full path and 
                      filename for the resulting mask (e.g., '.nii' or '.img').
      anat_path     - String or char array path to the base anatomical image 
                      (loaded as i1 in imcalc).
      GM_path       - String or char array path to the Gray Matter map (loaded as i2).
      WM_path       - String or char array path to the White Matter map (loaded as i3).
      CSF_path      - String or char array path to the CSF map (loaded as i4).

  Outputs:
      output        - Character array containing the console output generated 
                      by spm_jobman, captured via evalc.

  Example:
      log_out = whifun_anat_mask('C:\Data\Sub01_mask.nii', ...
                                 'C:\Data\T1.nii', ...
                                 'C:\Data\c1T1.nii', ...
                                 'C:\Data\c2T1.nii', ...
                                 'C:\Data\c3T1.nii');
