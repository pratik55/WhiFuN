WHIFUN_NIFTIREAD Reads a NIfTI file and applies scaling factors.

  [volume, info] = WHIFUN_NIFTIREAD(image_path) reads a NIfTI file,
  correctly applying the stored scaling and offset values from the file's
  header. This is a crucial step for ensuring that the voxel intensity
  values are interpreted correctly, as many NIfTI files store data as
  integers to save space and require a scaling factor to be applied for
  the correct floating-point representation.

  The function first reads the volume data and the header information
  using MATLAB's built-in `niftiread` and `niftiinfo` functions. It then
  applies the formula: `y = AdditiveOffset + x * MultiplicativeScaling`,
  where `x` is the raw data and `y` is the corrected data.

  Input Arguments:
  image_path - The full path to the NIfTI file to be read.

  Output Arguments:
  volume - A numeric array containing the corrected voxel data.
  info   - A structure containing the header information of the NIfTI file.
