FD_CALC Calculates the Framewise Displacement (FD) from a time series of 
  rigid-body head motion parameters.

  FD = FD_CALC(Y)

  Framewise Displacement is a scalar quantity summarizing head motion from
  one time point to the next, typically derived from 6 rigid-body
  realignment parameters (3 translations and 3 rotations). Rotations are
  usually converted to displacements on a sphere of a given radius (e.g.,
  50 mm).

  Input Arguments:
  Y   - Head motion parameters time series. Expected size:
        N_TimePoints x N_MotionParameters (where N_MotionParameters is 6,
        or 12 if including derivatives, but only the 6 primary parameters
        are used for FD calculation, typically after rotational parameters
        have been converted to displacement in millimeters).

  Output Arguments:
  FD  - A column vector of Framewise Displacement values (in mm).
        Size: (N_TimePoints - 1) x 1.

  Assumptions:
  1. The input matrix Y contains the 6 motion parameters where all 6 are
     in the same units (typically mm, assuming rotations have been
     converted to mm displacements using a standard radius).
  2. FD is calculated as the Euclidean distance (L2 norm) of the vector of
     changes in the 6 parameters between successive time points.
